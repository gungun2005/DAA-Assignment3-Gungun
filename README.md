# Graph Algorithms for Real-World Problems

##  Project Overview
This project implements four fundamental graph algorithms to solve practical real-world problems:
1. **Social Network Friend Suggestion** using BFS
2. **Google Maps Route Finding** using Bellman-Ford  
3. **Emergency Response System** using Dijkstra's Algorithm
4. **Network Cable Installation** using Prim's MST
